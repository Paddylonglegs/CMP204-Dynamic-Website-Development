              <p>"That's life" is recognisable as a Sinatra-style song in the beginning by the jazz/swing style. After being released in 1966, it went on to be very successful and an instant classic. It's been used in multiple movies, the most recent being Joker(2019). This song is a good way to put life into perspective, the ups and downs and how to not let it affect you and keep going.</p>

              <p>My Favourite song from Sinatra. Whenever the New York dream gets brought into conversation, this song will definitely be in the back of people's minds. Released in 1977 for the movie "New York, New York", the song details the mindset that it takes to be a New Yorker, "If I can make it there, I can make it anywhere", and the lyrics are so true in the concrete jungle.</p>

            <p>Which is why it resonates with so many people still to this day and became another instant classic.</p>

                <p>"My way" was one of the final songs Sinatra sang, at his final concert in 1995. It was a fitting way to end his great singing career, the song itself a fitting goodbye to the fans listening to his unknowingly final concert. Sinatra did do it his way, "I did it my way", he overcame odds and became a great swing/jazz singer. To this day he is still regarded as one of the best artists of the 20th century, to me he was the best.</p>
